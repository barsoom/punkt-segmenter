## Punkt sentence tokenizer

This code is a ruby port of the Punkt sentence tokenizer algorithm implemented by the NLTK Project ([http://www.nltk.org/]). Punkt is a language-independent, unsupervised approach to sentence boundary detection. It is based on the assumption that a large number of ambiguities in the determination of sentence boundaries can be eliminated once abbreviations have been identiﬁed.

The description of the algorithm is presented in the following academic paper:

> Kiss, Tibor and Strunk, Jan (2006): Unsupervised Multilingual Sentence Boundary Detection.  
> Computational Linguistics 32: 485-525.  
> [Download paper]

Here are the credits for the original implementation:

- Willy (willy@csse.unimelb.edu.au) (original Python port)
- Steven Bird (sb@csse.unimelb.edu.au) (additions)
- Edward Loper (edloper@gradient.cis.upenn.edu) (rewrite)
- Joel Nothman (jnothman@student.usyd.edu.au) (almost rewrite)

I simply did the ruby port and some API changes.
